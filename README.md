# expense_tracker

Dart is a client-optimized, object-oriented, modern programming language to build apps fast for many platforms like android, iOS, web, desktop, etc. Client optimized means optimized for crafting a beautiful user interface and high-quality experiences. Google developed Dart as a programming language.

I have developed this application using Flutter a popular cross platform Dart based framework used for App as well as Web development.
